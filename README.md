# Next.js 15 Unexpected Error with Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered in a Next.js 15 application when integrating a particular third-party library. The error is unexpected, the stack trace is not informative, and debugging proves challenging.

## Problem Description

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the application.
4. Observe the build error.

## Solution
The solution involves identifying the specific incompatibility between the third-party library and Next.js 15. This might require careful examination of the library's documentation, issue tracker, and potentially adapting the library's code to work seamlessly with Next.js 15's build process.
